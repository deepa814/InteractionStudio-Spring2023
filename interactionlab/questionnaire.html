        <p>I don’t have a lot of previous experience with coding, but I’ve been exposed to a lot of computer science adjacent concepts through my family as everyone else works in that field. When I was 7, I made a lot of dollmaker and fashion design games on Scratch. When I was around 10, my brother and I made a lot of simple flash games together, though I was on more of the design side than the code side. I’ve also written a lot of code documentation before as I’m extremely interested in nonfiction writing, such as for <a href="https://github.com/stomp-js/stompjs">stompjs</a> on Github. </p>
        
        <p>A couple of years back, I did the Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp, but I don’t remember that much of it. In my interaction class last semester, my experience was very poor. Our professor went through concepts very quickly without explaining them and never mentioned anything about how to design. I have used CSS in my webpages by looking up how to do things, but I feel like my understanding of the principles and properties of CSS is pretty poor. I barely understand JavasScript.</p>
        
        <p>I really enjoyed the creativity of the prompts that were given as assignments. I like pushing the bounds of creativity while doing web designs while also trying to make them functional. I liked the individual freedom we had to construct interactive designs. I also really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of building the code.</p>
        
        <p>With the way my professor taught, everything was confusing. I pretty much only really understood the basic html. With CSS, we didn’t really take time to learn things like the box model or different positions so I don’t really understand those. I used CSS by just looking up the effects I wanted and adding them, but it was confusing. JavaScript was also very confusing.</p>
        
        <p>I’m extremely excited about learning code!! I think the way this class is structured really works well with what I want to do, as I’m super interested in the intersection between design and tech. I’m looking forward to making really interesting projects. I am nervous about having weak foundations from my previous course and having to catch up to the level that everyone else is already at.</p>
        
        <p>To feel less anxious, I would really appreciate thorough explanations of the basics, even if most people are familiar with the concepts. I would also appreciate lots of personal feedback on how to elevate my designs, if you have the time for it.</p>
        
        <p>I think it will definitely be a significant part of my design practice. I’m extremely interest in web design, frontend, and UI/UX. I also hope to collaborate often with programmers and use my technical knowledge for that. I am trying to learn more about the different careers I could have relating to these.</p>
        
        <p>Last semester, I used Brackets, which worked fine. I’m fine with switching editors if there is a better option.</p>
        
        <p>I have used GitHub many times before to help coders write documentation. I used GitHub for my own projects last semester and understand how to have live sites there.</p>
        
        <p>CSS is a vending machine, HTML is the snacks inside it, and Javascript is the keypad.</p>

            My therapist asked me this morning about my goals,
	“What would you change about your life?
		I thought about it. 	A minute passed.
				“Maybe nothing significant, because nothing comes to mind.”
		I went home. I bought groceries. 	My arms hurt.
I tried to read for class, but the light was hurting my eyes. I saw a spider on my wall.
I couldn’t stop crying. I was so tired. I love living.

        <p id="red">Block, Inline-Block, and Inline are HTML display values. A block element, such as div, starts on a new line, can have a margin, and fills the entire width. An inline element, such as span, remains in the same line. Inline elements can appear inside a block element. It fills the width of the content. Inline-Block elements can have padding and margins on all four sides.</p>
