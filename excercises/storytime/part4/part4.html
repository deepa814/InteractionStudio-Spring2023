    <p>When I was 7, I kept telling my brother how I wanted to make my own cute games. He then introduced me to Scratch, to get me started. I had a lot of fun with it. I made a lot of small projects, extremely happy with bringing my ideas to life. Here are screenshots of of a dress-up game I made in 2010, where you clicked different parts of her outfit to make them change.

    <p>A lot of projects are still up online, but I also deleted a lot of them because I was embarrassed.
