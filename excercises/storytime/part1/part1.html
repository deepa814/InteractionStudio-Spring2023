    <p class="main">Welcome to my personal website!
Today I’m going to tell you a story.</p>

    <p>My brother, who’s three years older than me, is my best friend. He taught me how to use a computer. I was around 5 at the time and still learning how to read in English. He was 8, and adored computers.</p>

    <p>He’d sit down patiently and show me around the settings. Very quickly, my favourite application became MS Paint. I loved to draw a lot more than reading, and I loved all the colours and effects.</p>
