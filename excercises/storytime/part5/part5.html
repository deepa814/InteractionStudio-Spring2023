    <p>As we got a couple of years older, my brother started getting into Flash himself. By then, I was no longer interested in doing the coding but I told him I'd do the art. We came up with the title “Fried Ice Cream” productions.</p>
    
    <p>Our first game was called “Bactobob” and was a runner game where you were bacteria trying to escape white blood cells in your way. The game mechanisms were terrible and full of errors, making it awful to play.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, none of the games are playable anymore after Flash was discontinued. We don't have most of them saved anywhere, but I remember how fun they were.</p>
