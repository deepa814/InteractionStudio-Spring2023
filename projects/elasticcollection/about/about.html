                <p class="summary"> Lesbian pulp fiction novels were a genre of literature that began in the mid-20th century. The most significant aspect of these is that they were written primarily for a lesbian audience. At a time when homosexuality was deeply stigmatised (as it still is in most of the world) this was an incredibly important source of representation for the community.
                </p>
                <p class="summary">With many members of the queer community living in isolation, having access to representation provided a sense of belonging. The writers of these books were often queer themselves, contributing to queer culture and literature of the time. The existence of this genre is quite beautiful, especially during a time where the primary audience for most media was for cis men. 
                </p>
                <p class="summary">The stories have many common themes, mostly being intense love stories full of heightened emotions. Very frequently, they deal with protagonists who challenge social norms in one way or another. They discuss the distress and personal crisis that comes with living as a queer person and forming relationships. Many of them are erotic in nature, but they are written for a queer audience, rather than being aimed at cis men like most lesbian erotica is. 
                </p>
                <p class="summary">These stories are a representation of queer joy. With their beautifully illustrated covers and dramatic plot-lines, they are a significant aspect of queer history, especially when considered as a stepping stone to more mainstream representation. This collection pays tribute to the romance genre by giving a lighthearted way to find books to read sorted by tropes.
